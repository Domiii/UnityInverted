# UnitySandbox2
Random collection of game elements :)


Most importantly:

* 1st-person gravity grab dynamics; similar to the gravity gun in HL2
* 3rd-person gravity grab dynamics; the the cursor can attract and drop objects like a giant magnet
* 3D planet gravity: hug the surface of a sphere (still a bit bugged)
