Random collection of game elements, primarily physics based stuff.


Most importantly:

* [Gravity grab dynamics](https://github.com/Domiii/UnitySandbox2/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/GravityGrab): grab/attract/drop/throw objects
  * 1st-person gravity grab dynamics
    * similar to the gravity gun in HL2
  * 3rd-person gravity grab dynamics
    * the cursor can attract and drop objects like a giant magnet
* [animated stairs](https://github.com/Domiii/UnitySandbox2/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/AnimatedStairs)
  * Stairs widen when approaching, walking them
  * Stairs contract again when too far away
* [3D planet gravity](https://github.com/Domiii/UnitySandbox2/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/GravityHug): hug the surface of a sphere (still a bit bugged)
